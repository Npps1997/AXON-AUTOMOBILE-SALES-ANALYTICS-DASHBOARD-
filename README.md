Axon Automobile, a small classic car seller, had trouble keeping track of their sales data. The sales team found it hard to understand the information, and the management struggled to get accurate sales reports in a timely manner. To solve this, Axon decided to use Microsoft Power BI and SQL to create a tool that helps them manage and analyze their sales data better.

## Here's how we did it:

- We gathered details about sales, products, orders, customers, and payments from their database using SQL.
- We analyzed the data to figure out what's important and how it can help the company.
- We connected the SQL database to Power BI and transformed the data to create visuals that show the sales information clearly.
- We focused on organizing the data to see how different aspects relate to each other, using features in Power BI like DAX and quick measures.
- The result is a user-friendly dashboard that provides insights into sales, customer profiles, orders, payments, and employee performance.

We used tools like SQL to manage sales data, Power BI to visualize it, Excel for additional work, and PowerPoint to design the dashboard.

## The impact:

- The dashboard gives the sales team and management a clear view of how the company is doing.
- It shows real-time data and helps understand trends in sales, customer behavior, and employee performance.
- The dashboard makes it easier to make smart decisions and improve the way they do business.

In conclusion, our solution has helped Axon Automobile use their data effectively, leading to better decisions and improved business results. The interactive dashboard provides the insights they need to keep Axon on the road to success.
